PAGI - Perl Asynchronous Gateway Interface

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.001001 (Beta)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Raw PAGI application
    use Future::AsyncAwait;
    use experimental 'signatures';

    async sub app ($scope, $receive, $send) {
        die "Unsupported: $scope->{type}" if $scope->{type} ne 'http';

        await $send->({
            type    => 'http.response.start',
            status  => 200,
            headers => [['content-type', 'text/plain']],
        });

        await $send->({
            type => 'http.response.body',
            body => 'Hello from PAGI!',
            more => 0,
        });
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PAGI (Perl Asynchronous Gateway Interface) is a specification for asynchronous
Perl web applications, designed as a spiritual successor to PSGI. It defines a
standard interface between async-capable Perl web servers, frameworks, and
applications, supporting HTTP/1.1, WebSocket, and Server-Sent Events (SSE).

=head1 UTF-8 HANDLING OVERVIEW

PAGI scopes provide decoded text where mandated by the spec and preserve raw
bytes where the application must decide. Broad guidance:

=over 4

=item *
C<$scope->{path}> is already UTF-8 decoded from the percent-encoded
C<$scope->{raw_path}>. If you need exact on-the-wire bytes, use C<raw_path>.

=item *
C<$scope->{query_string}> and request bodies arrive as percent-encoded or raw
bytes. Higher-level frameworks may auto-decode with replacement by default, but
raw values remain available via C<query_string> and the body stream. If you
need strict validation, decode yourself with C<Encode> and C<FB_CROAK>.

=item *
Response bodies and header values sent over the wire must be encoded to bytes.
If you construct raw events, encode with C<Encode::encode('UTF-8', $str,
FB_CROAK)> (or another charset you set in Content-Type) and set
C<Content-Length> based on byte length.

=back

Raw PAGI example with explicit UTF-8 handling:

    use Future::AsyncAwait;
    use experimental 'signatures';
    use Encode qw(encode decode);

    async sub app ($scope, $receive, $send) {
        # Handle lifespan if your server sends it; otherwise fail on unsupported types.
        die "Unsupported type: $scope->{type}" unless $scope->{type} eq 'http';

        # Decode query param manually (percent-decoded bytes)
        my $text = '';
        if ($scope->{query_string} =~ /text=([^&]+)/) {
            my $bytes = $1; $bytes =~ s/%([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})/chr hex $1/eg;
            $text = decode('UTF-8', $bytes, Encode::FB_DEFAULT);  # replacement for invalid
        }

        my $body = "You sent: $text";
        my $encoded = encode('UTF-8', $body, Encode::FB_CROAK);

        await $send->({
            type    => 'http.response.start',
            status  => 200,
            headers => [
                ['content-type',   'text/plain; charset=utf-8'],
                ['content-length', length($encoded)],
            ],
        });
        await $send->({
            type => 'http.response.body',
            body => $encoded,
            more => 0,
        });
    }

=head2 Beta Software Notice

B<WARNING: This is beta software.>

This code is provided for developers interested in exploring and advancing
asynchronous web programming in Perl. The only guarantee made is that the
test suite passes.

B<Do not use this in production.>

If you are interested in contributing to the future of async Perl web
development, your feedback, bug reports, and contributions are welcome.

=head1 COMPONENTS

This distribution includes:

=over 4

=item L<PAGI::Server>

Reference server implementation supporting HTTP/1.1, WebSocket, SSE, and
multi-worker mode with pre-forking.

=item L<PAGI::Middleware::*>

Collection of middleware components for common web application needs.

=item L<PAGI::App::*>

Bundled applications for common functionality (static files, health checks,
metrics, etc.).

=back

=head1 PAGI APPLICATION INTERFACE

PAGI applications are async coderefs with this signature:

    async sub app ($scope, $receive, $send) { ... }

=head2 Parameters

=over 4

=item C<$scope>

Hashref containing connection metadata including type, headers, path, method,
query string, and server-advertised extensions.

=item C<$receive>

Async coderef that returns a Future resolving to the next event from the
client (e.g., request body chunks, WebSocket messages).

=item C<$send>

Async coderef that takes an event hashref and returns a Future. Used to send
responses back to the client.

=back

=head2 Scope Types

Applications dispatch on C<< $scope->{type} >>:

=over 4

=item C<http>

HTTP request/response (one scope per request)

=item C<websocket>

Persistent WebSocket connection

=item C<sse>

Server-Sent Events stream

=item C<lifespan>

Process startup/shutdown lifecycle events

=back
